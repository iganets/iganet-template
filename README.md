This repository serves as a template for standalone applications for [IgANets](https://github.com/iganets/iganet), a novel approach to combine the concept of deep operator learning with the mathematical framework of isogeometric analysis.

## Setup instructions

Don't commit to this repository as it serves as a generic template repository. Instead, clone it for your application, say, https://github.com/IgANets/iganet-myapp and adapt it as follows:

1. Change `iganet-template` to `iganet-myapp` in the `README.md` file

2. Change `TEMPLATE` to `MyApp` in the `CMakeLists.txt` file

3. Implement your application(s) in the `src` directory.

_Optional:_

4. By default, the template repository contains the following GitHub actions

   - `.github/workflows/gitlab-sync.yml` synchronizes commits between GitHub and GitLab. If you want this synchronization to work you need to create a repository with the same name in https://gitlab.com/IgANets. Otherwise, delete this file
   - `.github/workflows/cmake-multi-platform.yml` basic skeleton for multi-platform CI/CD

## Usage instructions

The `CMakeLists.txt` file of this template repository is set up in a way that it downloads the latest master version of [IgANets](https://github.com/iganets/iganet) as dependency and imports the target `iganet::core`. To configure and build a standalone executable for each source file in the `src` directory follow the instructions below:

1. Create a `build` directory
   ```shell
   mkdir build
   ```

2. Configure `cmake`
   ```shell
   cmake <path-to-iganet-template-directory>
   ```

3. Compile the code
   ```shell
   make
   ```
